        <h1>Market Overview</h1>
        <br/>
        <h3>Gaming market </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>The market GAMBOL is entering is expansive and growing fast. According to a market<br/>
        report by online gaming research firm Newzoo, the industry generated US$108.9 billion in<br/>
        2017, a 7.8% increase from the previous year [2].</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Mobile games formed the most lucrative segment with a revenue of US$46.1 billion, and an<br/>
        annual growth of 19%. According to the report, mobile gaming is 42% of the global market.<br/> 
        Meanwhile, in the same year, the PC game market generated US$29.4 billion and console<br/> 
        game markets US$33.5 billon.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In terms of regions, Asia-Paciﬁc dominates the market. In 2017, its revenue reached US$51.2<br/> 
        billion, almost double that of the second ranked North American. The best performing<br/> 
        countries in the Asian-Paciﬁc region were China, Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Southeast Asia (SEA) is another region that shows a lot of potential [3]. In 2017, 126 million<br/>
        of the global 2.2 billion gamers logged in from this region. And the market generated more<br/>
        than US$1.09 billion. The region also shows one of the highest growth rates, 40% each year.<p>

        <h3>Cryptocurrency markets</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>In the traditional payment methods, centralized authorities such as banks and other financial<br/> 
        institutions maintain the ledger on which transactions get recorded. When Satoshi Nakamoto <br/>
        created and launched Bitcoin, the process of maintaining a transaction ledger was <br/>
        revolutionized.</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>Bitcoin introduced and proved a concept of a community, through consensus on a peer-to-<br/>
        peer network of computers, maintaining a ledger instead of a central authority. The shared<br/>
        public ledger is more secure and reliable than one that a central authority oversees. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The shared public ledger is what is known as blockchain, and is useful in more ways than<br/>
        recording financial transactions. In particular, it can serve as the platform on which <br/>
        developers can host and launch applications such as those related to online gaming. The <br/>
        blockchain removes the central authority from the picture and makes decentralized platforms <br/>
        on the Internet viable.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Like online gaming, the cryptocurrency market is growing at a considerably high rate. In a<br/>
        span of nine years, the amount of investment held in cryptocurrencies has exceeded US$400<br/>
        billion—total market capitalization.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In total there are over 1000 active cryptocurrencies, and a similar number or more number of <br/>
        digital tokens on various blockchains. Cryptocurrencies that launched after the success of<br/> 
        Bitcoin are called altcoins—shortened from alternative coins. Some of the altcoins with the <br/>
        highest market capitalizations include Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>According CoinMarketCap, a site that tracks cryptocurrency markets, daily trade volumes <br/>
        exceed US$15 billion, with 41.8% of that being of Bitcoin [4].</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>What drives the adoption of cryptocurrencies is their decentralised nature. It is important that <br/>
        they are not subject to the whims of a few trusted policy makers, as with the traditional <br/>
        currencies. Their market value is truly determined by supply and demand.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Together with the rise of cryptocurrencies, hundreds of blockchain companies have also been<br/>
        set up [5]. Nearly every sector of the economy you look at, several startups using the <br/>
        technology are either already in operation or in the process of launching. The online gaming <br/>
        industry isn’t any different. </p>

        <h1>Technology Overview</h1>
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL aims to be a decentralised online gaming platform. For this to happen, Gambol <br/>
            will run on blockchain technologies. GAMBOL’s architecture will be built on top of <br/>
            Ethereum frameworks.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By using a blockchain, the platform assures transparency to players, hosts and other <br/>
            stakeholders. On the GAMBOL platform two types of information will go onto the <br/>
            blockchain. These are:</p>
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>The results of each gameplay round</li>
                <li>The winning conditions and transactions of each round.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Smart Contract</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Smart contracts are agreements written in code that self-execute when pre-determined<br/> 
                conditions are met [8]. GAMBOL smart contracts will ensure that games play out according<br/> 
                to pre-agreed rules. They sustain fairness, transparency and trust among those involved. <br/>
                Depending on the game, the winning algorithm will be stated in the smart contract, <br/>
                something any of the participant can check out by accessing the software source code.<br/>
                Once a game session ends, the smart Contract will fetch the results and guide their <br/>
                forwarding onto the Blockchain through connected servers.</p>
            <br/>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>ERC20</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>To make smart contracts viable both on GAMBOL and on Ethereum blockchain, the BOL <br/>
                token that will be the means of value transmission is designed to meet ERC-20 standards [9].<br/>
                That means it can be used within the ecosystem of the Ethereum blockchain. It also means it <br/>
                qualifies to be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges and can be held in commonly used <br/>
                wallets. This makes the trading of the token easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>User ﬂow </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>First, users login and authenticate through the GAMBOL servers. This produces an access <br/>
            token to be used in multiple games. They then have the choice to either host their own games <br/>
            or join sessions created by others. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>All games added and veriﬁed on GAMBOL will have direct interaction to the blockchain <br/>
            either through provided a software development kit (SDK) or an application programming <br/>
            interface (API).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At the start of every game round, a smart contract is created to guide it and make sure <br/>
            promises made are honoured.</p>
        </div>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="<?= base_url() ?>/images/smart_contract.png">
        <div class="container">
            <h3>PvP Games</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will run games and players will connect to the network through a browser. They <br/>
            can join games others are hosting or opt to host themselves if they meet the conditions. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL’s primary role is to ensure the results of the game are always updated according to <br/>
            pre-agreed rules and players get the promised rewards when they win. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>P2P Hosting</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will provide an infrastructure to host peer-to-peer games. These games are hosted<br/>
            on each player’s devices instead of the GAMBOL server. The P2P hosting provides a chance</br>
            for third party developers to build games without touching the GAMBOL main </br/>
            infrastructures. However the SDKs and APIs will allow the games to interact with the <br/>
            GAMBOL platform and have their sessions recorded on the blockchain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Security </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>The GAMBOL follows the latest security standards available, namely the CCSS standards <br/>
            [10]. This will ensure all our private keys are stored in the most recommended manner. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Smart contracts deployed by GAMBOL and 3rd party developers will go through unit testing <br/>
            before receiving live access to the gambol infrastructure. This will provide a safe <br/>
            environment for all stakeholders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>3rd Party Development  </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will provide an SDK and API access for all third party developers. However, only <br/>
            limited information will be shared towards the external parties. A third party developer will <br/>
            have to go through an OAuth2— the industry-standard protocol for authorization—process in <br/>
            order to obtain an access token to the system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>The GAMBOL wallet</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Players will not use fiat money (such USD) to enter bets on the GAMBOL platform. Instead <br/>
            they will have to use the BOL token. That is because smart contract applications do not <br/>
            support fiat currencies. Also creating and using our own token is necessary to ensure a truly <br/>
            secure and transparent betting platform.</p>
            <p>As a token fully compliant with the ERC20 standard, the BOL token is compatible with Ether <br/>
            wallets such as MyEtherWallet, and it is also tradable on major crypto exchanges. To provide <br/>
            more options for players we plan to release an open-source GAMBOL Wallet app for iOS, <br/>
            Android, PC and Mac. </p>
            <p>In addition to strong fund protection and other exclusive features, the GAMBOL Wallet will <br/>
            allow players to easily obtain BOL tokens, as the app will be interlinked with third-party <br/>
            exchanges through APIs.</p>

            <h3>Loyalty referral program </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will charge a commission rate from the winning players. The collected fund will <br/>
            be distributed to the referral user (If there’s any).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The referral system contains three levels: </p>
            <br/>
            <p>First level: 15%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Second level: 5%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Third level: 5%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>For example, if player A wins 1000 BOL tokens during a game session, when they exit, they <br/>
            are charged 10 BOL token (1% commission rate). A first level referral will earn 1.5 BOL <br/>
            token from that amount. Second and third level referral users will earn 0.5 BOL token each. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>3rd Party Game Developer</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>If the game by 3rd party game developer is accepted on the GAMBOL platform, the game <br/>
            developer will share 25% of the commission GAMBOL collects. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>In a game, player A wins 1000 BOL tokens, Player B win 500 BOL token and Player C loses <br/>
            1500 BOL tokens, when the refresh period reaches, player A will need to contribute 10 BOL <br/>
            token as commission, player B need to contribute 5 BOL token and Player C doesn’t <br/>
            contribute any. The total commission collected is 15 BOL token, so the game developer will <br/>
            earn 3.75 BOL tokens. </p>
