        <h1>Market Overview</h1>
        <br/>
        <h3>Gaming market </h3>
        <br/>
        <p>The market GAMBOL is entering is expansive and growing fast. According to a market
        report by online gaming research firm Newzoo, the industry generated US$108.9 billion in 
        2017, a 7.8% increase from the previous year [2].</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Mobile games formed the most lucrative segment with a revenue of US$46.1 billion, and an
        annual growth of 19%. According to the report, mobile gaming is 42% of the global market. 
        Meanwhile, in the same year, the PC game market generated US$29.4 billion and console 
        game markets US$33.5 billon.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In terms of regions, Asia-Paciﬁc dominates the market. In 2017, its revenue reached US$51.2
        billion, almost double that of the second ranked North American. The best performing
        countries in the Asian-Paciﬁc region were China, Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Southeast Asia (SEA) is another region that shows a lot of potential [3]. In 2017, 126 million
        of the global 2.2 billion gamers logged in from this region. And the market generated more
        than US$1.09 billion. The region also shows one of the highest growth rates, 40% each year.<p>

        <h3>Cryptocurrency markets</h3>
        <br/>
        <p>In the traditional payment methods, centralized authorities such as banks and other financial
        institutions maintain the ledger on which transactions get recorded. When Satoshi Nakamoto
        created and launched Bitcoin, the process of maintaining a transaction ledger was
        revolutionized.</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>Bitcoin introduced and proved a concept of a community, through consensus on a peer-to-
        peer network of computers, maintaining a ledger instead of a central authority. The shared
        public ledger is more secure and reliable than one that a central authority oversees. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>The shared public ledger is what is known as blockchain, and is useful in more ways than
        recording financial transactions. In particular, it can serve as the platform on which 
        developers can host and launch applications such as those related to online gaming. The
        blockchain removes the central authority from the picture and makes decentralized platforms 
        on the Internet viable.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Like online gaming, the cryptocurrency market is growing at a considerably high rate. In a
        span of nine years, the amount of investment held in cryptocurrencies has exceeded US$400
        billion—total market capitalization.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In total there are over 1000 active cryptocurrencies, and a similar number or more number of
        digital tokens on various blockchains. Cryptocurrencies that launched after the success of 
        Bitcoin are called altcoins—shortened from alternative coins. Some of the altcoins with the
        highest market capitalizations include Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>According CoinMarketCap, a site that tracks cryptocurrency markets, daily trade volumes 
        exceed US$15 billion, with 41.8% of that being of Bitcoin [4].</p> 
        <br/>
        <p>What drives the adoption of cryptocurrencies is their decentralised nature. It is important that
        they are not subject to the whims of a few trusted policy makers, as with the traditional
        currencies. Their market value is truly determined by supply and demand.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Together with the rise of cryptocurrencies, hundreds of blockchain companies have also been
        set up [5]. Nearly every sector of the economy you look at, several startups using the
        technology are either already in operation or in the process of launching. The online gaming
        industry isn’t any different. </p>

        <h1>Technology Overview</h1>
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL aims to be a decentralised online gaming platform. For this to happen, Gambol
            will run on blockchain technologies. GAMBOL’s architecture will be built on top of
            Ethereum frameworks.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>By using a blockchain, the platform assures transparency to players, hosts and other
            stakeholders. On the GAMBOL platform two types of information will go onto the
            blockchain. These are:</p>
            <br/>
            <ol>
                <li>The results of each gameplay round</li>
                <li>The winning conditions and transactions of each round.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Smart Contract</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Smart contracts are agreements written in code that self-execute when pre-determined
                conditions are met [8]. GAMBOL smart contracts will ensure that games play out according
                to pre-agreed rules. They sustain fairness, transparency and trust among those involved.
                Depending on the game, the winning algorithm will be stated in the smart contract, 
                something any of the participant can check out by accessing the software source code.
                Once a game session ends, the smart Contract will fetch the results and guide their 
                forwarding onto the Blockchain through connected servers.</p>
            <br/>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>ERC20</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>To make smart contracts viable both on GAMBOL and on Ethereum blockchain, the BOL
                token that will be the means of value transmission is designed to meet ERC-20 standards [9].
                That means it can be used within the ecosystem of the Ethereum blockchain. It also means it
                qualifies to be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges and can be held in commonly used
                wallets. This makes the trading of the token easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>User ﬂow </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>First, users login and authenticate through the GAMBOL servers. This produces an access
            token to be used in multiple games. They then have the choice to either host their own games
            or join sessions created by others. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>All games added and veriﬁed on GAMBOL will have direct interaction to the blockchain
            either through provided a software development kit (SDK) or an application programming 
            interface (API).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At the start of every game round, a smart contract is created to guide it and make sure
            promises made are honoured.</p>
        </div>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="<?= base_url() ?>/images/smart_contract.png">
        <div class="container">
            <h3>PvP Games</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will run games and players will connect to the network through a browser. They
            can join games others are hosting or opt to host themselves if they meet the conditions. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL’s primary role is to ensure the results of the game are always updated according to
            pre-agreed rules and players get the promised rewards when they win. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>P2P Hosting</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will provide an infrastructure to host peer-to-peer games. These games are hosted
            on each player’s devices instead of the GAMBOL server. The P2P hosting provides a chance
            for third party developers to build games without touching the GAMBOL main 
            infrastructures. However the SDKs and APIs will allow the games to interact with the
            GAMBOL platform and have their sessions recorded on the blockchain.
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Security </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>The GAMBOL follows the latest security standards available, namely the CCSS standards
            [10]. This will ensure all our private keys are stored in the most recommended manner. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Smart contracts deployed by GAMBOL and 3rd party developers will go through unit testing 
            before receiving live access to the gambol infrastructure. This will provide a safe
            environment for all stakeholders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>3rd Party Development  </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will provide an SDK and API access for all third party developers. However, only
            limited information will be shared towards the external parties. A third party developer will 
            have to go through an OAuth2— the industry-standard protocol for authorization—process in
            order to obtain an access token to the system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>The GAMBOL wallet</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Players will not use fiat money (such USD) to enter bets on the GAMBOL platform. Instead
            they will have to use the BOL token. That is because smart contract applications do not 
            support fiat currencies. Also creating and using our own token is necessary to ensure a truly
            secure and transparent betting platform.</p>
            <p>As a token fully compliant with the ERC20 standard, the BOL token is compatible with Ether
            wallets such as MyEtherWallet, and it is also tradable on major crypto exchanges. To provide 
            more options for players we plan to release an open-source GAMBOL Wallet app for iOS,
            Android, PC and Mac. </p>
            <p>In addition to strong fund protection and other exclusive features, the GAMBOL Wallet will
            allow players to easily obtain BOL tokens, as the app will be interlinked with third-party
            exchanges through APIs.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Loyalty referral program </h3>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL will charge a commission rate from the winning players. The collected fund will
            be distributed to the referral user (If there’s any).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The referral system contains three levels: </p>
            <br/>
            <p>First level: 15%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Second level: 5%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Third level: 5%</p>
            <br/>
            <p>For example, if player A wins 1000 BOL tokens during a game session, when they exit, they 
            are charged 10 BOL token (1% commission rate). A first level referral will earn 1.5 BOL 
            token from that amount. Second and third level referral users will earn 0.5 BOL token each. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h3>3rd Party Game Developer</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>If the game by 3rd party game developer is accepted on the GAMBOL platform, the game
            developer will share 25% of the commission GAMBOL collects. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>In a game, player A wins 1000 BOL tokens, Player B win 500 BOL token and Player C loses
            1500 BOL tokens, when the refresh period reaches, player A will need to contribute 10 BOL
            token as commission, player B need to contribute 5 BOL token and Player C doesn’t 
            contribute any. The total commission collected is 15 BOL token, so the game developer will
            earn 3.75 BOL tokens. </p>
