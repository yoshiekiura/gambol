        <h2>Current problem in online gaming/gambling industry </h2>
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <p>GAMBOL is moving online gaming from centralized architectures to decentralized ones. 
                But that is not simply because it has become possible to do so. It is because centralized 
                systems on which players and hosts operate at the moment have inherent weaknesses that can
                only be addressed by decentralizing them and adopting technologies that remove control from 
                a few and gives it to all stakeholders.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The following are the most pressing problems in the online gaming industry at the moment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diminished fairness as opportunities for manipulation and fraud are high</li>
                <li>Lack of transparency especially with players not accessing the random number generator (RNG) [6].</li>
            	<li>As a centralised system, the focus is mostly away from the player.</li>
            	<li>Poor security of data as well as that of making and receiving payments </li>
            	<li>High cost of transactions and slow processing </li>
            	<li>Poor integration and interoperability of platforms, and few API that accept external game developers </li>
            <ul>

        <h2>The GAMBOL solution  </h2>
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The developers behind GAMBOL have put time and effort to identify weaknesses in the current online gaming architecture. 
            They have invested even more into designing viable solutions that leverage on the opportunities blockchain and smart contracts offer.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The utmost goal is to empower and protect players, hosts and developers equally. Notwithstanding the class of stakeholder, the platform 
            will protect good actors from bad actors while everyone gets a smooth and enhanced experience.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The specific solutions take the following shapes:</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Fairness</strong> - All games are designed with smart contracts, which self-execute without intervention. The code of every game 
            on our platform can be veriﬁed on GitHub. GAMBOL will not host any games but will facilitates hosting and playing of games. The main objective 
            is to level the ground for everyone and makes it impossible for anyone to manipulate results.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Transparency</strong> - The games RNG algorithm will be the implementation of provably fair algorithm [1] on the blockchain. That 
            means during the generation of randomness, players receive key data that they can use to proof that the host doesn’t game the system. 
            In addition, much of the process is guided with smart contracts thus taking the potential of manipulation off the hands of the host and 
            maintaining a 100% transparency for everyone.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Player centric</strong> - GAMBOL is a total decentralised platform that facilitates player versus player (PvP) interactions. 
            It is a platform that is built with a priority for peer-to-peer interaction. This makes each player the centre of every action that they are 
            involved in. And this forces game developers to design their games with the view of the player at the top of the list of considerations.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In particular, the blockchain and smart contracts makes it a reality that player will have true ownership of digital game assets such as 
            tokens. Players can move around and even outside the platform with their asset collections. This is because the ownership is not recorded 
            on a centralized server database in control of a third party but on a shared public ledger.</p> 
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Security</strong> - GAMBOL using blockchain and smart contracts offers security for user data and lowers risk that come with 
            payment methods. On centralized platforms, players are forced to use traditional payment methods, which collect personally identifying data. 
            The databases on which this data is kept become attractive to hackers. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>To make it unnecessary for stakeholders to give personally identifying information, all payments within GAMBOL platform will be through 
            cryptocurrencies. Users are welcome to use Bitcoin, Ethereum and a few other coins that will be added later. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>But for in-game value transactions, GAMBOL offers the Bol token (BOL) that is easy to integrate with games on the platform. The BOL token 
            meets the ERC20 standards, meaning its transactions get recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and it can be used through existing wallets. </p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Less Costly</strong> - GAMBOL will collect low or insignificant transaction fees. This is made possible by the fact that the platform 
            is on top of a public blockchain, which is not a central authority with a lot of overheads. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Part of the transaction fee will go into settling gas payment on the Ethereum blockchain and the rest to maintain the infrastructure. </p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Open Source</strong> - The GAMBOL without stringent conditions will provide an open API for game developer to create games and 
            integrate with the platform. And the source code for all games will be available on GitHub.</p>

        <h2>GAMBOL main concept   </h2>
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <p>GAMBOL is a decentralised platform for games of skill. It integrates innovative solutions that blockchain technology provides to make 
            online gaming fair and transparent, leaving the outcome to player’s skills. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>The platform solves trust issues extending to itself. Every game on GAMBOL platform integrates with smart contract whose algorithms can 
            be reviewed by anyone on an open public ledger as well as on the code control platform GitHub. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>With immense help from blockchain, GAMBOL system will be absolutely transparent. The outcome of each individual round of game is random 
            and will be determined by multi factor model of random number generation (RNG) algorithm, where the ﬁnal result is determined based on 
            several input parameters. The players are able to proof after the fact the random generation wasn’t manipulated. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>On GAMBOL, anyone with BOL tokens can become a host as much as a player. To be a host however, one needs to hold a certain minimum amount 
            of the BOL tokens in their wallet to support the running of the game. The host creates a game room, decide on the bet volumes and invite 
            players to participate. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Once the host decides on the details of a game, the system generates a smart contract with the rules that will guide it. The smart contract 
                enters into an autopilot mode once the game begins and all the processes are out of the host’s control.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The pay-outs system is automatic as well and based on the smart contract. In every individual game, the blockchain receives, from designated 
            servers, and records final tallies, which become immutable—the record cannot be changed once it is made. The system then, as stipulated in 
            the smart contract, deducts from or makes pay outs to players. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>The BOL token, is the main in-game currency. The use of BOL token will be for betting in game, reward program, bonus and also pay out for 
            aﬃliate program. By using BOL token, it allows every player to bet with minimal transaction and lower down the transaction fee. Moreover, 
            BOL token can minimise the system time spent on game processing, transferring of funds and ensures high levels of liquidity. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>GAMBOL players are allow to exchange their tokens (BOL) at any given time to their preferred cryptocurrency and withdraw funds. GAMBOL will 
            register the BOL token on major cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
